                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Designed and implemented a programming language called sudoCode                        
                        \item Learned C++ from scratch as a personal challenge                    
                        \item Lexed the code into tokens before transforming the tokens into a parse tree             
                        \item Transformed the parse tree into an AST and executed it

                        \item Leveraged OOP principles to create a modular code base
