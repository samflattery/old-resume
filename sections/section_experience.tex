	    \begin{itemize}
			\item Worked with the security team to find bugs in Envoy, an open source L7 proxy, through randomized fuzz testing
			\item Wrote a fuzz target for Envoy's xDS protocol, which provides a centralized infrastructure for distributing configuration files to Envoy nodes
			\item Implemented an abstract state tracker that maintained the correct state of the nodes to verify that updates to the configurations were properly processed after executing the fuzzed input
			\item Fixed two logical bugs in Envoy's implementation of xDS found by my fuzzer
			\item Increased fuzz coverage over key files by more than 40\%
        \end{itemize}
